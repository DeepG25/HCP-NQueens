# HCP-NQueens

We have solved the N-Queens problem using five different methods which include backtracking and bitmasking algorithms. We have also parallelized the N-Queens problem for faster computations. Application for this problems include chess engines, deadlock prevention in processes and memory management without the clashes between different processes.
